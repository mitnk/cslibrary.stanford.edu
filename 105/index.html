Linked lists are a superb source of complex practiceproblems. Link list problems are simple to define, yet can have complicated,pointer-intensive solutions (which is why they are often used on examsand in interviews). If you are serious about your pointer/algorithm skills,there's no substitute for practice and this is the place to start.<p>For a few problems, multiple solutions are presented, such as iterationvs. recursion or dummy node vs. reference pointer. The problems are: Count,GetNth, DeleteList, Pop, InsertNth, SortedInsert, InsertSort, Append, FrontBackSplit,RemoveDuplicates, MoveNode, AlternatingSplit, ShuffleMerge, SortedMerge,SortedIntersect, Reverse, and RecursiveReverse.<h3>Download <a href="LinkedListProblems.pdf">LinkedListProblems.pdf</a></h3>(revised Jan, 2002)<p>See also...<ul><li>The silly <a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/104/">Binky Pointer Fun</a>&nbsp;video -- animated introduction to pointers</li><li><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/">Pointers and Memory</a> --basic concepts of pointers and memory</li><li><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/">Linked List Basics</a> --introduction to the basics of linked lists</li><li><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/">Binary Trees</a> -- all aboutbinary trees</li><li><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/109/">The Great Tree-List RecursionProblem</a> -- the greatest pointer/recursion problem ever&nbsp; (advanced)</li></ul><p><br><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/help.html">Downloading help<hr></a>Up to the<a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/">CS EducationLibrary Home</a></body></html>

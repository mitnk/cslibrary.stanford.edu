This hasthe advantage that you can just click on them and see the results immediatelywithout any special software. Also, HTML is nice for reading things online,since it uses your font preferences and it does not introduce unnecessarypage breaks. On the other hand, HTML files do not include the image files.So if you copy an HTML file to look at later, the necessary image filesmay be missing. (Internet Explorer includes a Save As Archive feature cansave an HTML document with its images, but it's a proprietary format. Itwould be nice if the W3C created a standard for this problem.)<h2>PDF</h2>PDF can be a little more complex to download, but PDF files include allthe necessary images so they are self-contained. For every HTML documentin the CS Ed Library, there is a PDF version available. The PDF versionis exactly the same content -- just the format is different.<h2>PDF Download</h2>Usually, just clicking the PDF link will download the file. If that confusesthe browser, try your browser's "Save Link As" (right-click, or click-hold)command to download the PDF and save it as a local file. Then you can either(a) drag and drop the file onto Acrobat to open it, or (b) run Acrobatand then use the Open command to open the file. This has the advantagethat you have more control about saving and naming the file where you want.<p>There is a known bug in IE 4.x where it gets confused downloading binaryfiles such as PDF. A workaround may be to option click the link to saveit as a file. There is also a known bug in IE 4.x, and 5.x here the clientrequests the same download multiple times in quick succssion which willslow everything down. Run IE 5.0.1 sp2 or 5.5 sp1 to avoid this problem.<h2>PDF Details</h2>The <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">AcrobatReader</a> program that displays PDFs is available for free from Adobe.You don't have to register -- you can just skip right to the download step.<p>If you can downlod the file, but Acrobat won't display it, you probablyhave a problem with your browser configuration. I think the Acrobat installertries to set this for you when you install Acrobat, but sometimes it doesn'tstick.<p>CSLibrary provides the PDF file with their correct MIME type which is<tt>application/pdf</tt>. Your browser needs to know that files with thatMIME type should be viewed using Acrobat. You configure your browser todo that in its preferences. In Netscape it's called the "helpers" or "applications".In IE it's called "File Helpers". In any case, configure your browser sothat the MIME type <tt>application/pdf</tt> is handled by Acrobat. Sometimesyou have the choice of using the "plug-in" or "application" handling. Irecommend using "application" because I think it's a little more reliable.<p><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/">CS Education Library home</a></body></html>

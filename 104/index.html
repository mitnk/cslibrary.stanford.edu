The MIME type of AVI is <tt>video/avi</tt> (theolder variants are <tt>video/x-msvideo</tt> or <tt>video/msvideo</tt>).<p>You can let your browser plug-in play the video in a browser window,or save the AVI file and play it with a dedicated video playing application(Quicktime Movie Player or Microsoft Video Player). To download the moviefile from your browser, you typically right-click, option-click, or click-holdon the URL, and it will let you save the file locally. Alternately on myversion of Netscape (4.5, Mac), the QuickTime plug-in has a "save moviefile in cache" option, so after watching the movie you can go to your browsercache and pull the movie out.<p>Quicktime may be obtained <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/index.html">here</a>.<h2>Uses</h2>Anyone can use the video to amuse themselves and review the basics of thepointers -- but only for about 3 minutes! A more likely use of the videois as a fun little segment integrated in to a first or second lecture onpointers.<p><img SRC="assign.gif" ALT="binky with =" height=184 width=211 align=RIGHT><h2>Redistribution</h2>As with all materials in the CS Education Library, you have almost unlimitedrights to copy and redistribute this content.

What Java is missing ispointer address arithmetic, but the video does not mess around with thatlevel. It just examines the fundamental structures of pointers, dereferencingand assignment -- Java has all of those in the basically the same way thatC, C++ and Pascal do. The fact that Java has the <b>NullPointerException</b>suggests that somebody thinks it has pointers!<h3>What's this "pointee" stuff?</h3>Sadly, there is no established word for "the thing the pointer points to".Across different languages and situations, there's a great variety in thetype of thing that pointers can point to. Unfortunately you really needa term for "the thing the pointer points to" to write simple descriptionsof pointer structures. So I use the word "pointee" for "the thing the pointerpoints to", and I try to only make statements about "pointers" and "pointees"which are true across all different languages and situations.<h2>Postscript</h2>I hope you enjoy this material in the spirit of goodwill in which it isgiven. Thanks to Stanford Universirty and Eric Roberts for giving me theopportunity to create things like this. Someday I may seek out real fundingfor the CS Ed Library.<p>Cheers,<br>Nick Parlante<br><a href="mailto:nick.parlante@cs.stanford.edu?subject=PointerFun">nick.parlante@cs.stanford.edu</a><hr><p>Up to the <a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/">Stanford CS Education</a>Library home</body></html>
